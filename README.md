# Statistical-Analysis-Graduate-Admission-Criteria
In this group project, we will employ a multilinear regression model to predict the probability of being admitted in a graduate university using these variables:
1. **GRE Score**
2. **TOEFL Score**
3. **University Rating**
4. **Statement of Purpose (SOP)**
5. **Letter of Recommendation (LOR)**
6. **CGPA**
7. **Research Experience**

The dataset has been taken from this website [1].
